# Pybi! 

## This branch in untested

Pybi is intended to be a GUI to describe and visualize pandas DataFrames. Eventually make some simple data analysis on them.

Strong dependencies are pandas (implies numpy and matplotib) to DataFrame data management and PyQt4 for the graphical user interface.

## Expectations:

Make a free, simple and "scalable"(?) GUI *PowerBI-ish* or *Tableau-ish* 

### TODO:
1. MAKE A SIMPLE GUI:

* ~~place for the plot~~ 

* ~~dataframe loader~~ (only csv)

* dataframe info (~~columns~~, describe(?)) 

* ~~some buttons to do stuff~~

2. FUNCTIONALITY:

* ~~read data from disk~~

* ~~DataFrame and column selection~~

* do some plots/histograms/descriptions of a column(s)

3. TAKE IT TO THE LIMIT

* move to python3 

* move functions to different modules
