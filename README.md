[![Waffle.io - Issues in progress](https://badge.waffle.io/HaraldHeitmann/Pybi.png?label=in%20progress&title=In%20Progress)](http://waffle.io/HaraldHeitmann/Pybi)

Pybi is intended to be a GUI to describe and visualize pandas DataFrames. Eventually make some simple data analysis on them.

Strong dependencies are pandas (implies numpy and matplotib) to DataFrame data management and PyQt4 for the graphical user interface, eventually sklearn maybe(?)

## Expectations:

Make a free, simple and "scalable"(?) GUI *PowerBI-ish* or *Tableau-ish* 

### TODO:
1. MAKE A SIMPLE GUI:

* ~~place for the plot~~ 

* ~~dataframe loader~~ (only csv)

* dataframe info (~~columns~~, describe(?)) 

* ~~some buttons to do stuff~~

2. FUNCTIONALITY:

* ~~read data from disk~~

* ~~DataFrame and column selection~~

* do some ~~plots/histograms/scatter~~/descriptions of a column(s)

* ~~add filter column (to plot distinctly different mebers of a column (i.e. plot in red all members where the column equal 1, etc))~~

3. ADVANCED ANALYSIS:

* implement logistic regression

* implement linear regression

* implement k-means clustering

* PCA (? is it worth-it? how to implement?)

4. TAKE IT TO THE LIMIT

* move to python3 :muscle::muscle:

* move functions to different modules :muscle:
