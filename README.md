# Pybi! 


Pybi is intended to be a GUI to describe, visualize pandas DataFrames and eventually make some simple data analysis on them.

Some natural dependencies will be pandas (implies numpy and matplotib) and PyQt4 to make the graphical user interface

## Expectations:

Make a free, simple and scalable GUI *PowerBI-ish* or *Tableau-ish* 

### TODO:
1. MAKE A SIMPLE GUI:
*. place for the plot
*. dataframe loader
*. dataframe info (columns, describe(?)) 
*. some buttons to do stuff
2. FUNCTIONALITY:
*. read data from disk
*. do some plots/histograms/descriptions of a column(s)
*.
